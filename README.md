A Tactical Perspective
Real Madrid could rough up the flanks of Arsenal early, leading 4-2-4. Valverde and Modric will try to dominate the midfield, while Mbappé and Vinícius will search for the occasional counterattack. It will be literal and high pressing fighting.
That said, Saka and Martinelli each have a tendency to do their best work on the break and Arsenal spend a great deal of time soaking up pressure and remaining narrow out of possession. Rice and parley tucked in front, set pieces remain a vital weapon.

Predictions and Probabilities
On The left we see Real Madrid at 6/1, Arsenal 1/7 to progress.
Match Odds: Arsenal 7/2, Real Madrid 7/10, Draw 3/1.
We know the kind of late-game magic Real Madrid is capable of at the Bernabéu, so this is no one and done, not until the final whistle blows. Which team is theoretically meant to make it through? Arsenal.
At least Arsenal will have home comfort, when the Bernabéu will host the rematch: they can take a respectable three-nil aggregate back to Gunners HQ. Real Madrid will require a terrific effort to advance to the last four, with most of its stars not having made the cut. And now comes, for Arsenal, undefeated, unbroken in Europe so far, a shot at the far more exotic territory of a Champions League final
